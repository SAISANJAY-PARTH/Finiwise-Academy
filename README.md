FinWise Academy is a web-based platform focused on enhancing financial literacy and helping users achieve financial independence. It offers a suite of financial calculators (SIP, FD, Loan EMI, PPF, EPF, CAGR, Rental Yield, Net Salary, Inflation) to support budgeting, saving, and investment planning.

The platform features a personalized dashboard where users can access calculators, view/download their calculation history (TXT/Excel), and manage their accounts. Built with HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript, and PHP for dynamic interactions, it includes smooth modals, animations, and AJAX-based login/signup functionality. User data is stored securely in a MySQL database (user_auth), with prepared statements and SSL deployment practices for security.

Signup generates a secure 6-character code and stores user details; Login validates and redirects users to dashboard.php. A contact form logs queries into the database, and a history page enables users to track and manage past calculations.

The UI includes a responsive design, navigation bar, social media links (Instagram, LinkedIn, X, GitHub), and a splash screen with animated logo. Educational content and modals (like “My Expertise”) offer guidance on budgeting and saving strategies.

FinWise Academy’s mission is to make financial tools and knowledge accessible, encouraging informed financial decisions and long-term growth.
